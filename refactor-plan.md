# Refactoring and Improvement Plan

This document outlines a plan to refactor and improve the codebase, focusing on three key areas: error handling, performance, and data management.

## 1. Error Handling and User Feedback

### Objective
Create a centralized error-handling module to provide clear, user-friendly notifications and simplify debugging.

### Implementation Steps
- [x] **Create a `NotificationService` module**: This module will be responsible for displaying notifications to the user. It will support different notification types (e.g., success, error, warning) and provide a consistent look and feel.
- [x] **Develop a centralized `ErrorHandler`**: This handler will catch unhandled exceptions and route them to the `NotificationService`. It will also log detailed error information to the console for debugging purposes.
- [x] **Integrate the `ErrorHandler`**: Replace all instances of `console.error` with calls to the new `ErrorHandler`. This will ensure that all errors are handled consistently and that users receive clear feedback.

## 2. Performance of Semantic Similarity Engine

### Objective
Improve the performance of the semantic similarity engine by introducing a caching mechanism and performance monitoring.

### Implementation Steps
- [x] **Implement a caching mechanism**: Create a cache to store the results of similarity computations. This will avoid redundant processing and reduce latency. The cache will use a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy to manage its size.
- [x] **Introduce performance monitoring**: Add timers to track the execution time of key operations in the semantic similarity engine. This will allow for targeted optimizations and provide insights into the performance of the engine.
- [x] **Refactor the `semantic-similarity.ts` module**: Update the module to use the new caching mechanism and performance monitoring.

## 3. Data Management and Storage

### Objective
Implement data pagination and lazy loading to ensure efficient memory management and a responsive user experience.

### Implementation Steps
- [x] **Introduce a `Pagination` utility**: Create a utility to handle the logic of paginating large datasets. This will include functions for calculating page offsets, limits, and total pages.
- [ ] **Implement lazy loading**: Refactor the data-loading logic to fetch data in smaller, manageable chunks as needed. This will ensure that the extension remains responsive, even with large datasets.
- [ ] **Update the UI**: Modify the UI to support pagination, including adding controls for navigating between pages.
